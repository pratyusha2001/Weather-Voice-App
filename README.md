# Weather-Voice-App

Weather App is a voice-app created using Voiceflow and published on Google. This voice-app makes use of an online API (https://api.weatherbit.io/v2.0/current?city={city}&key=d0267406c3414239b9af5e27a8ba9e5f) to return the weather of the city entered within {} in the API URL to the user. The action can be invoked by typing or saying "Talk to Weather App" on any Google Assistant enabled device logged in with the developer's Google credentials.

The app is tested on various platforms:

## Note:
Voiceflow has updated the subscription plans and now in the Starter plan permits only 2 projects. One can only have 2 working projects within Voiceflow at a time. Hence, the working project might not be available.
